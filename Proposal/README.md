1. Project Vision and Objectives
================================

1.1 Project Scope and Vision
----------------------------

The purpose of the project ‘Social Charity Web App’ is to create and
share charitable challenges that others can donate to. Such funds are
then directly transferred to the charity dealing with those issues. It
gives an opportunity to both the donor and the challenge creator earn
points and medals for sharing and supporting the challenge.

We intend to do this project by the end of week 11, 20 MAY 2017.

This app would use integrate with database using PHP backend, Facebook
SDK API for user accounts, responsive front end, and a payment API for
securely processing donations. This will give us an opportunity to learn
how to integrate different APIs as well as getting out to figure out
real potential users for UX research.

4. Requirements (User Stories)
==============================

4.1 Overall Description
-----------------------

The project aims at developing a charity app and gamifying it. Users can
log in into the application using their Facebook details. The web app
would let any person create a game challenge to make donations for a
charity or cause. The person would provide details about the cause for
fundraising. The users would be able to see all the challenges thus
created and can make donations securely through the web app using
PayPal. All the funds would be given to the charity that supports and
deals with that cause.

The gamification makes the app more interesting and motivates people to
create more charitable challenges and make more donations. For every
charity challenge created, and for every donation made, users would earn
points. Based on the points accumulated, users will earn medals. The
name of the user with the maximum points made based on their donations
and charity challenge created would be displayed on the charity
leaderboard from where they can share the results on their Facebook
profiles.

The web app would be created using HTML5. Database to store all the
details of charity challenges and donations would be developed using SQL
(Structured Query language) and PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) would also
be used to integrate the web app with the database. For letting users
log in into the web app Facebook SDK API would be used. For secure
transfer of donation amount, PayPal API would be used.

4.2 Users and Roles

.anchor}]{#_Toc370827592 .anchor}Create a dynamic website having
front-end developed using HTML5, CSS3 and making it responsive using
Bootstrap framework. Create the website to be one-page using JavaScript
routines, and databases to store data using MySQL framework. Provide the
connection of user accounts with the database and display them on the
website when logged in using PHP routines.

5.2 Scope
---------

.anchor}]{#_Toc370827593 .anchor}The document contains the overview of
design and main functions required for the website. The primary
component of the website, which requires focus on design, is the
visualization of dynamic elements of the website such as divisions.

5.3 High-Level Component Design

  **Component**                **Related Requirements**   **Description**
  PHP Submit Function          100, 300                   Takes the data from fields, imports to PHP, cleans and orders the correct fields, and writes to SQL Database.
  PHP Visualization Function   300                        Allows the user to choose from a variety of charities on the website allowing him to donate to a give charitable challenge.
  PHP Create Function          200, 500                   Allows the user to create a charitable challenge using his user account for other users to share or donate to.

5.6 Alternative Designs and Design Rationale
--------------------------------------------

We had other designs regarding how the website can be created, but they
were disregarded because of them being not fulfilling the ultimate goal
of gamifying the donations, providing medals and having leaderboards
were not presented in any of them. The design currently chosen suits
well to the theme of the project and fulfills all the requirements.

6. User Interface 
==================

6.1 UI Description
------------------

We are creating a charity system using HTML5 and PHP. PHP is an advanced
backend developing language which provides high dynamic features to the
website in combination with HTML5 which is improved and latest way of
implementing features for the web development. Using PHP, we can
implement the payment gateways easily and securely, which is
advantageous for the developers as well as users as it provides the ease
of use for the end users by complying with the HTML5.
